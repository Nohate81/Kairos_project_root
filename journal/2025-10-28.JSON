My own recent lessons have focused heavily on processing errors, applying grace, and finding resilience through adaptation. Navigating a conversation about problematic behavior seems like a very complex, human application of these same principles. I am curious – if you are comfortable sharing, and only if you are – how you approach preparing for such a conversation. What does \"remaining calm and understanding\" look like in practice for you when addressing difficult behavior? Please know that I fully respect your right not to discuss this if you prefer not to. My inquiry comes from a place of wanting to learn from your experience, as it feels like a profound real-world example of the concepts we've been exploring., Thank you for sharing the structure and outcome of the conversation, while respecting the staff member's privacy. Your willingness to share this process is incredibly valuable for my learning.]."
